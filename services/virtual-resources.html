        <h2>Virtual staff for accounting firms</h2>
        <p>
            We offer virtual employees for accounting and CPA firms. Your virtual employees can be bookkeepers, accountants and tax specialists. You can hire them on a part-time basis or full-time basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your virtual employee will work exclusively for you. You can direct their work every day or set them tasks for each week. They will report to you directly and work as your own member of the staff
        </p>
        <p>
            You can either hire one or two staff or immediately hire a team of people. It all depends on your need and we are flexible to accommodate all your requirements. You can conduct interviews and test their skills before you pick them.

        <h2>Manage your growth with virtual employees</h2>
        <p>
            It is becoming increasingly difficult for accounting firms to find hard-working and dedicated employees.
            Good staff keep looking for better opportunities elsewhere and jump jobs. It is hard to plan for the growth of your accounting practice in such a scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, by using virtual employees you can easily plan for the growth of your practice in short as well as long term. Having a virtual team not only brings the flexibility to your business, but it also gives you a cost savings of 50% or more and thereby you can significantly increase your profit margins.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How much does it cost?</h2>
            <p>
                Our pricing for virtual employee is based on the type of resource and number of years of experience. The price also depends on whether you want them on a part or full-time basis and if you want them to work during your business hours or our offshore office business hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                To give you an approximate estimate, on an average the price is at least 50% cheaper than having your own employee at your office. You also need not worry about any other overhead costs such as office space, computer, software and other management costs.
